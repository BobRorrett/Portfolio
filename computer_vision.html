      <h2>Controlling a rolling robot using computer vision and path planning</h2>

        <h5> This project involved building a fully autonomous rolling robot from scratch. In a team of three, I was
          responsible for creating the computer vision and navigation system. The project was meant to replicate a
          satellite communicating with a rover on the surface of Mars. Therefore a webcam was placed high above the work
          area. The computer vision and navigation system was created using Python and OpenCV, and communicated with the
          robot wirelessly via a TCP connection. <br><br> It was up to us to decide what we wanted our robot to do.
          We decided to show it navigating through an environment filled with obstacles, and also crossing a "Martian
          highway" to
          show its real time response to a changing environment</h5>

          <h3> The Robot</h3>
          <p>The robot was a rolling robot, contained within a plastic ball. It was self balancing, with a pendulum used
            for turning. It relied on shifting its centre of gravity to make it roll.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the ball was clear and the
            internal hardware was mostly constant, clusters of internal LEDs were used to determine the position and
            orientation
            of the robot.

          <h3> Path planning</h3>
          <img src="Engineering/Computer vision/Setup.webp" style="max-width: 600px;">
          <p>The vision system was capable of detecting the position and orientation of the robot, as well as obstacles
            and travel destinations. ArUco codes were used to mark these destinations. The Astar search algorithm was
            used to plan the routes that the robot could take to avoid the green obstacles. <br> <br>
            This was done using various colour masks and pixelating the images.

          <img src="Engineering/Computer vision/Setup2.png" style="max-width: 600px;">
          <p>The Martian highway was projected onto the floor, using a projector. Cars, represented by ArUco codes,
            would enter the the two lanes from the left and right. The image processing software that I developed
            identifies the cars, determines their speed, and then predicts when they will enter the section of road
            that the robot has to cross. The robot then waits until the algorithm determines a safe time to cross, and
            then safely rolls across the road.The cars were spawned randomly and at different speeds, and the algorithm
            gained all the information about the environment from a webcam, next to the projector.
