                      <p> During my placement year at university i worked for Coalesce, a product development company specialising in medical devices. I had a great year learning from the team and designing mechanisms for dry powder inhalers.  </p>

                      <p> 3D printing has become extreemly accessible, with a wealth of online knowledge at your fingertips and affordable machines. I have had a lot of fun maintaining and upgrading my printer over the last few years, and it has been exteremly useful for both my university and home projects. </p>

                      <p> What home doesnt need a forge? I spent lockdown building a coffee-can forge, and making a series of small knives. It is safe to say i wont be packing it all in to become a blacksmith anytime soon, but i had a lot of fun. </p>

                      <p> A fancy dress costume taken too far? These lifelike hobbit feet were built on top of a Â£3 pair of primark trainers, with a 3D printed shell, covered in liquid latex soaked tissues to create a skin like effect, and finshed with some paint and fake hair.</p>
